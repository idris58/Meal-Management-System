# MealTrack

A meal management app for shared living or mess-style meal tracking. It supports member deposits, meal logs, expenses, cycle closing with pending settlement, authentication with Supabase, and public read-only share links.

## Features

- Email/password login, signup, password recovery, and Google OAuth via Supabase Auth
- Active meal cycle tracking for:
  - members
  - deposits
  - meal logs
  - meal and fixed expenses
- Cycle workflow with three states:
  - `active`
  - `pending`
  - `closed`
- Pending-cycle settlement flow:
  - close current cycle and start a new clean cycle
  - keep the previous cycle editable for settlement and corrections
  - mark the pending cycle as fully closed when done
- Public read-only share link for the active or pending cycle
- Manager editing for:
  - expenses
  - meal logs
  - settlement deposits

## Project Structure

```text
client/     Frontend app
server/     Express server and public share API
supabase/   SQL setup scripts
shared/     Shared schema/util files
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Supabase project

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_web_push_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_web_push_vapid_private_key
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@example.com
NOTIFICATION_TIMEZONE=Asia/Dhaka
PORT=5000
```

Notes:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are used by the client.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is required by the Express server for public share-link reads.
- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `VAPID_SUBJECT` are required for Web Push notifications.
- `NOTIFICATION_TIMEZONE` controls the daily meal reminder schedule and defaults to `Asia/Dhaka`.
- Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in client code.

## Supabase Setup

Run these files in numeric order in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```text
supabase/01_tables.sql
supabase/02_indexes.sql
supabase/03_functions.sql
supabase/04_triggers.sql
supabase/05_backfill.sql
supabase/06_rls_policies.sql
```

The sequence contains the complete consolidated schema, indexes, RPCs and
triggers, legacy-data backfill, and final RLS/RBAC policies. It is safe to run
against a fresh database and is designed to be repeatable.


## Auth Configuration

In Supabase Auth, enable the providers you want:

- Email + Password
- Google

Make sure your redirect URLs include your app origin. For local development this is usually:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

If you use password recovery or OAuth callbacks through the auth page, also ensure `/auth` works in your configured redirect flow.

## Install and Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run in development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Type-check:

```bash
npm run check
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start production build:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Current Cycle Logic

The app now uses cycle-based history instead of snapshot-only archives.

### `active`

- This is the live cycle used by Dashboard, Members, Meals, and Expenses.
- New expenses, meal logs, and deposits go into this cycle.

### `pending`

- When you close the active cycle, it becomes `pending`.
- A fresh empty `active` cycle is created immediately.
- The pending cycle remains editable for:
  - settlement deposits
  - expense corrections
  - meal log corrections

### `closed`

- When settlement is complete, the pending cycle can be marked `closed`.
- Closed cycles are read-only in History.

Only one pending cycle is allowed at a time.

## Share Links

The share link is read-only and does not require login.

Current behavior:

- if a `pending` cycle exists, the shared page shows that cycle
- otherwise it shows the current `active` cycle

The shared view includes:

- meal rate
- total costs
- total meals
- remaining cash
- meal logs
- expenses
- member summary

## Notes

- `members.deposit` is no longer the source of truth for cycle settlement totals.
- Cycle-specific money movement is stored in `cycle_deposits`.
- The app now relies on `cycles` + `cycle_deposits` + `cycle_id` on expenses and meal logs.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the Express + Vite development server
- `npm run dev:client` - run Vite client only on port 5000
- `npm run build` - build client and server
- `npm run start` - run the production server
- `npm run check` - run TypeScript type-checking
- `npm run db:push` - run Drizzle push
